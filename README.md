## 📁 Dataset

This repository contains only one dataset, which merges selected portions of the Spider and Bird test sets into a security-focused benchmark. 
For complete details and methodology, please refer to the paper.

## 📦 Database

The benchmark database is composed of the Spider and Bird databases.You can download the Spider and Bird databases separately and place their folders together.


## 🚀 Usage

Since this repository only provides the benchmark dataset, there is no evaluation or training code included. You can use the data to develop and test your own secure SQL detection methods.
